# a_mazer
a_mazer is a visual neural-networking suite that implements my own simple, generic neural networking core titled NNt3. NNt3 functions as it's own standalone module to extend and build on in other projects but I chose to include it's source code in the project directly so it's obvious that all of it was self-written.  

This project was created for my A-level computing course in order to demonstrate to a client how even a *relatively* complex problem like a maze can be solved with a genetic algorithm and time. This was under the context of managing UGVs' navigation around arbitrarily given warehouses.

## Some Features
For a full list of features my project analysis please see my Project Analysis.
   
a_mazer aims to slimline the process of understanding what neural networking is and how it works a genetic algorithm. This is because while at an expert level deep learning can get very complicated very fast, the actual principles and basics are quite simple to wrap your head around. Therefore the features I have added (or plan to add) aim to facilitate quick understanding. These features are:  
* [x] Uses NNt3 - my own, simple, open-source neural networking API
* [x] Graphical maze creation (w/ any size of grid)
* [x] Customisation options when building an evolutionary series (mutation rate, _"brain"_ size etc.)
* [x] Instant graphical playback of a given species' actions
* [x] Ability to fast-forward an arbitrary amount of generations
* [x] Completely multi-threaded for high-speed evolution
* [ ] Graphical ancestry view of a given species
